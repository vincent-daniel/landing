			<h2>1. What is the RV4H? 30th Edition</h2>
			<p>
				This is an oenotourism rally designed to help you discover the Bordeaux vineyards in a fun and friendly atmosphere. It is one of the main events organised by Kedge BS Bordeaux (formerly BEM). With its quarter of a century, the rally is also the oldest!
			</p>
			<h2>2. Who is the RV4H for?</h2>
			<p>
				The rally is open and reserved for all students in France. Although the majority of the crews are from Bordeaux, the event also brings together 200 students from all over France and even abroad! Each year, in crews of 4 or 5, around 500 students gather in the heart of the Bordeaux vineyards.
			</p>
			<h2>3. Who organises RV4H?</h2>
			<p>
				It is AOC, the oenological association of Kedge BS Bordeaux, which is organising the event down to the last detail. AOC is the largest student oenological association in France. For more information, visit the AOC Kedge Facebook page!			
			</p>
			<h2>4. When is the RV4H?</h2>
			<p> 
				The dates are still being kept secret but we will let you know soon! 
			</p>
			<h2>5. What does RV4H consist of?</h2>
			<p>
				On Saturday morning, the serious stuff starts! All the crews get together for the big start. This is the moment to discover the theme and the costumes chosen by the teams who compete in creativity each year.
				All the teams are given a road book containing the riddles to be solved to find their way to the mysterious castle in the morning. Once this first stage has been completed, tastings, entertainment and a visit to the castle are offered in a friendly atmosphere.
			</p>
			<p>
				But then, don't the participants risk losing time in their race? Don't panic, the aim of the rally is not to be as fast as possible! Depending on the riddles guiding the teams, the number of kilometres making up each route is conscientiously measured. Teams with a mileage counter closest to our estimates are declared winners. So beware of course errors that can prove fatal!
				And isn't drinking alcohol during a car rally dangerous (and illegal)?
				Absolutely! At each stage, drivers are required to submit to compulsory alcohol tests before taking to the road again. So take it easy on the tastings!
			</p>
			<p>
				After this first morning stage, the participants, equipped with their trusty road book, must go to the Château étape du midi where everyone will be able to eat and take part in the various activities set up. Once they have eaten their fill, they can set off again in search of the final castle stage in the afternoon.
			</p>
			<p>
				The road book will guide each crew to the final castle where all participants are expected at the end of the afternoon. This is certainly the end of the race, but the festivities will continue all evening with a well deserved hearty dinner and an evening on the spot. The participants are also invited to spend the night there and to meet again the next morning for a final brunch.
				Finally, a prize-giving ceremony will reward the crews who have covered the least number of kilometres over the entire route with prizes commensurate with their prowess! No need to worry about the others, as all the teams will leave with a batch of bottles offered by our generous (and prestigious!) partners.
			</p>
			<p>
				The weekend ends with this ceremony and all that's left for the participants to do is to make an appointment for the following year!
